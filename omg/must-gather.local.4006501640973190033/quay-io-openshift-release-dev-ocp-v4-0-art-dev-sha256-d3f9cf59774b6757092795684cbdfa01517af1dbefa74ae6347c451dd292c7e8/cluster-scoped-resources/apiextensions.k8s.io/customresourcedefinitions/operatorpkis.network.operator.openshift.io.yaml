          creates a CA and a certificate signed by that CA. The certificate has both
          ClientAuth and ServerAuth extended usages enabled. \n More specifically,
          given an OperatorPKI with <name>, the CNO will manage: - A Secret called
          <name>-ca with two data keys: - tls.key - the private key - tls.crt - the
          CA certificate - A ConfigMap called <name>-ca with a single data key: -
          cabundle.crt - the CA certificate(s) - A Secret called <name>-cert with
          two data keys: - tls.key - the private key - tls.crt - the certificate,
          signed by the CA \n The CA certificate will have a validity of 10 years,
          rotated after 9. The target certificate will have a validity of 6 months,
          rotated after 3 \n The CA certificate will have a CommonName of \"<namespace>_<name>-ca@<timestamp>\",
          where <timestamp> is the last rotation time."
